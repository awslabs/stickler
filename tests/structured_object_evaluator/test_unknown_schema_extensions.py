"""An extension key Stickler does not honour is rejected, not dropped.

A dropped key left a model that built, ran, and produced numbers wrong in the
direction of over-reporting accuracy. The sharpest shape was a typo alongside a
correctly-spelled sibling, which produced a configuration nobody would choose:

    x-aws-stickler-comparitor: ExactComparator   (typo, dropped)
    x-aws-stickler-threshold:  1.0               (honoured)
    -> LevenshteinComparator at threshold 1.0

Raising is safe here in a way it is not elsewhere in the codebase: a schema is
authored once and read deterministically, so there is no risk of failing on
document N of a corpus after succeeding on N-1. The author is present and the
mistake is in a file they can edit.
