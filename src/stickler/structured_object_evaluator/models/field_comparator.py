        #       This call to compare_recursive() creates a new ComparisonEngine and
        #       re-traverses all nested fields, even though we're already in the middle
        #       of a recursive traversal from the parent ComparisonEngine. This causes
        #       O(nÂ²) behavior for deeply nested structures.
        #
        #       Example: Invoice -> Contact -> Address
        #       - Parent engine traverses Invoice fields
        #       - Hits Contact field, calls this method
        #       - This creates NEW engine to traverse Contact fields
        #       - Hits Address field, creates ANOTHER new engine
        #       - Each level re-traverses its subtree unnecessarily
        #
        #       Better approach: Pass dispatcher context down through recursion to avoid
        #       creating new engines. This would require refactoring the recursion model
        #       to be more explicit about context passing.
