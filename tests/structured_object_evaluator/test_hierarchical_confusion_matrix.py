Test hierarchical confusion matrix structure for nested structured models.

This test file validates the hierarchical confusion matrix structure that:
1. Provides recursive nesting structure with "overall" and "fields" at each level
2. Uses recursive structure instead of flat dotted paths
3. Tests up to 4 levels of nesting depth

Structure being tested:
Level 1: Order
Level 2: Product (in List[Product])
Level 3: Attribute (in Optional[List[Attribute]])
Level 4: AttributeProperty (in Optional[List[AttributeProperty]])
